    <h1>The Jungle Book</h1>
 <div id="story">  <p><strong>A wolf family finds a young boy wandering in the jungle and adopts him,
    giving him the name Mowgli. He becomes part of the wolf pack, and Baloo,
    the old bear and Bagheera, the panther, teach him the Law of the Jungle.
    However, Shere Khan, the tiger, doesn’t like having a child who will become
    a man living in the jungle, and wants to kill him.
    One day Mowgli is taken prisoner by the monkeys who live in an
    abandoned city in the jungle. Baloo and Bagheera get help from Kaa, the
    python, and rescue him.
    As Mowgli gets older he is in great danger from Shere Khan. The one thing
    that all animals are afraid of is fire, so he goes to a nearby village and
    steals a pot with fire in it. He uses the fire to fight Shere Khan, but he knows
    that he will have to kill Shere Khan to be safe.
    As Mowgli gets older, the animals begin to realize that he can’t live with
    them in the jungle when he is a grown man. He returns to the village
    where he is adopted by a family. But Shere Khan finds him. This time
    Mowgli kills Shere Khan. But the villagers are now afraid of Mowgli, so
    they chase him away and he returns to live in the jungle.</strong></p>

    <h2>Aladdin</h2>
    <div id="story"><p><strong>Once upon a time, there was a poor boy named Aladdin who lived with his mother. One day, a rich stranger came to their house looking for Aladdin. ‘I am a merchant,’ he told Aladdin’s mother. ‘I have come all the way from Arabia. I want to take your boy with me for a little work, but I will pay him so much that you will not be poor anymore.Aladdin’s mother soon agreed because they really needed the money. However, she did not know that the man who said he was a merchant was actually a magician.

        The next day, Aladdin packed his things and left with the merchant. They traveled for many hours, after which the merchant stopped. Aladdin was surprised, as it was a lonely spot and there was nothing or no one anywhere.The merchant took out some colored powder from his pocket. Then he threw it at the ground and the next moment there was smoke all around. As the smoke cleared away, Aladdin saw a big opening in the ground like a cave. The merchant asked Aladdin to go inside the cave. ‘You will see lots gold inside, more than you will ever see in your life. Take as much as you want. Inside the cave, you will also see an old lamp. Just get it out for me.’ Aladdin became suspicious, but he entered the cave.Inside, he saw the cave was filled with gold. He filled up his pockets with gold and stuffed in as much as he could. When he could take no more gold, he looked for the lamp and found it. It was old and dirty. He took the lamp and called out to the merchant to help him out. ‘Give me the lamp first,’ the merchant said. Aladdin was afraid that if he gave the lamp to the merchant, he would leave him there. So he said ‘Please pull me out first.The merchant got angry and took out some more powder from his pocket. He threw it at the cave and the opening of the cave became shut with a huge rock. Aladdin was scared. He waited inside and shouted, hoping that someone would come and help. But many hours passed and no one came. As Aladdin was sitting alone, he started cleaning the lamp. Suddenly, a strange fog filled up the room and a voice said, ‘My Master, I am the genie of this lamp. What is your wish?’ It was a huge man who looked very strange and Aladdin was afraid of him. But the genie assured him that he would do as Aladdin asked him. ‘Take me to my home’ he said.The next instant, Aladdin was home and with his mother. They hugged each other and Aladdin told her all about his adventure. Aladdin called the genie again and he appeared, but now they were not afraid of him. He asked the genie for a palace and soon they were living inside a beautiful palace instead of the old hut where Aladdin had lived all his life.
