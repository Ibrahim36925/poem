    <h1>The Jungle Book</h1>
 <div id="story">  <p><strong>A wolf family finds a young boy wandering in the jungle and adopts him,
    giving him the name Mowgli. He becomes part of the wolf pack, and Baloo,
    the old bear and Bagheera, the panther, teach him the Law of the Jungle.
    However, Shere Khan, the tiger, doesn’t like having a child who will become
    a man living in the jungle, and wants to kill him.
    One day Mowgli is taken prisoner by the monkeys who live in an
    abandoned city in the jungle. Baloo and Bagheera get help from Kaa, the
    python, and rescue him.
    As Mowgli gets older he is in great danger from Shere Khan. The one thing
    that all animals are afraid of is fire, so he goes to a nearby village and
    steals a pot with fire in it. He uses the fire to fight Shere Khan, but he knows
    that he will have to kill Shere Khan to be safe.
    As Mowgli gets older, the animals begin to realize that he can’t live with
    them in the jungle when he is a grown man. He returns to the village
    where he is adopted by a family. But Shere Khan finds him. This time
    Mowgli kills Shere Khan. But the villagers are now afraid of Mowgli, so
    they chase him away and he returns to live in the jungle.</strong></p>
